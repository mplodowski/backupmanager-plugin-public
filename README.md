# Backup Manager Plugin

**Demo URL:** https://october-demo.renatio.com/backend/backend/auth/signin

**Login:** backup

**Password:** backup

Backup your application with ease.

The backup is a zip file that contains all files in the directories you specify along with a dump of your database. The backup can be stored on any of the filesystems you have configured in October. You can backup your application to multiple filesystems at once. In addition to making the backup, the package can also clean up old backups, monitor the health of the backups, and show an overview of all backups. The plugin can also notify you via mail when something goes wrong with your backups.

## Requirements

This plugin requires PHP 8.0, with the [ZIP module](http://php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) and Laravel 9.0 or higher. It's not compatible with Windows servers.

If you are using an older version of Laravel and October, take a look at one of the previous versions of this plugin.

The package needs free disk space where it can create backups. Ensure that you have **at least** as much free space as the total size of the files you want to backup.

Make sure `mysqldump` is installed on your system if you want to backup MySQL databases.

Make sure `pg_dump` is installed on your system if you want to backup PostgreSQL databases.

Make sure `mongodump` is installed on your system if you want to backup Mongo databases.

## Why is this a paid plugin?

Something that is free has little or no perceived value. Users do not commit to free products and only use them until something else looks nice and is free comes along. When I invest my time in the development of a new plugin I commit to supporting and maintaining it. I ask my customers to do the same. I do not make money from this plugin by advertisements, upgrades or additional services like hosting or setup.

Did you know that 30% of your purchase or donation goes to help fund the October Project?

My plugins take many hours to develop (40-120+) and even more hours to document and maintain. My paid plugins have to pay for both this time, and the time I am spending on free plugins and less successful paid plugins. This means that it will take even a successful plugin years to become profitable. Please consider buying an extended license if you want me to continue to maintain these plugins for the very small fee I ask in return or hire me for adding functionality that you feel is missing but valuable.

# Documentation

## Usage

After installation plugin will register backend **Backups** menu position.

**Application backup** button will create backup with all project files and database dump file. To change which files will be included see plugin **Settings**. Default settings will take project **base path** and exclude **vendor** and **node_modules** directories from it.

**Database backup** button will create only database backup.

**Clean old backups** button will clean up old backups based on the plugin **Settings**.

**Backup log** button will show the latest backup log in popup window.

> **Important note:** Log is not created when you manually run console command.

**Settings** button will redirect you to the plugin settings.

## Maximum execution time error

When you experience **Maximum execution time of ... seconds exceeded** error than most likely application backup is too large and PHP cannot do this process in a single request.

> What can I do?

1. Change **max_execution_time** property value in your PHP configuration.
2. Use [Scheduler](#scheduler) to perform automatic backups (recommended).
3. Use [Console commands](#console-commands) to perform backups.

## Settings

This plugin ships with settings page. Go to **Settings**, and you will see a menu item **Backup Manager** listed under **Backup** section.

### Destination

| Property            | Description                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

| **Disks**           | The disk names on which the backups will be stored. |

### Scheduler

Configure how often plugin will run automatic tasks for database backup, application backup, clean old backups and monitor the health of all backups actions.

> **Important note:** For scheduled tasks to operate correctly you must set up the scheduler: https://octobercms.com/docs/setup/installation#crontab-setup

### Security

Here you can specify password protection for backups. You will be asked to enter this password in order to unzip the backup file.

#### Password

Remember to use long strings and to keep your password safe â€“ **without it, you will never be able to open your backup**.

Leave it blank if you want to keep your backup without a password.

#### Encryption

It's common to encrypt backups before storing them somewhere to prevent unauthorized access.

It's important to try this workflow and also to decrypt a backup archive, so you know that it works and you have a working backup restore solution.

**Warning:** the default MacOS app to (un)archive ZIPs seems unable to open/extract encrypted ZIP files.
You should use an app like [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/) or [BetterZip](https://macitbetter.com/).

### Cleanup

| Property                                                 | Description                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Keep all backups for days**                            | The number of days for which backups must be kept.                                                      |
| **Keep daily backups for days**                          | The number of days for which daily backups must be kept.                                                |

| **Delete oldest backups when using more megabytes than** | After cleaning up the backups remove the oldest backup until this amount of megabytes has been reached. |

### Monitoring

A backup is considered unhealthy if the date of the latest backup is too far in the past to be useful or if the amount of storage space required for all backups is not available.

| Property                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Newest backups should not be older than days**  | Send mail notification when newest backup will be older than given days. Default to 1 day.                                                                                                                   |
| **Storage used may not be higher than megabytes** | Send mail notification when storage used for backups will be higher than given megabytes. Default to 5000 megabytes. Setting to 0 means the monitor will consider that the backup can use unlimited storage. |

### Dumping the database

The `mysqldump`/`pg_dump` are used to dump the database. If they are not installed in a default location, you can add a key named `dump.dump_binary_path` in October `database.php` config file. Only fill in the path to the binary. Do not include the name of the binary itself.

If your database dump takes a long time, you might exceed the default timeout of 60 seconds. You can set a higher (or lower) limit by providing a `dump.timeout` config key which specifies, in seconds, how long the command may run.

Here's an example for MySQL:

```
// config/database.php
'connections' => [
	'mysql' => [
		'driver' => 'mysql'
		...,
		'dump' => [
		   'dump_binary_path' => '/path/to/the/binary', // only the path, so without `mysqldump` or `pg_dump`
		   'use_single_transaction',
		   'timeout' => 60 * 5, // 5 minute timeout
		   'exclude_tables' => ['table1', 'table2'],
		   'add_extra_option' => '--optionname=optionvalue',
		]
	],
```

There is also a setting in backend area to exclude database tables from backup. By default, it will exclude logs tables.

## Configuring the backup disk

By default, the backup will be saved into the storage/app/October CMS/ directory of your October application. This folder most probably is configured to be public. We recommend that you create a disk named backups (you can use any name you prefer) in filesystems.php and select this disk in plugin Settings.

## Filesystems

Plugin supports following storage drivers:

* Local Storage
* FTP Storage
* Amazon S3 Cloud Storage
* Rackspace Cloud Storage
* Dropbox Cloud Storage

More drivers can be added on feature requests. Just create an issue with **[Feature Request]** in title, and I will see what can be done.

The filesystem configuration file is located at **config/filesystems.php**. Within this file you may configure all of your "disks". Example configurations for each supported driver is included in the configuration file. So, simply modify the configuration to reflect your storage preferences and credentials!

### Amazon S3 and Rackspace configuration

Install [October Drivers](http://octobercms.com/plugin/october-drivers) plugin.

Go to plugin **Settings** and check `s3/rackspace` disk in **Destination** tab.

### Dropbox configuration

Install [Dropbox Adapter](https://octobercms.com/plugin/renatio-dropboxadapter) plugin.

Read this external plugin documentation and configure Dropbox filesystem.

Go to plugin **Settings** and check `dropbox` disk in **Destination** tab.

### FTP configuration

Add new filesystem disk in `disks` array in `config/filesystems.php`:

```
'ftp' => [
    'driver'   => 'ftp',
    'host'     => '',
    'username' => '',
    'password' => '',
    'root'     => '',
    'ssl'      => true,
],
```

Go to plugin **Settings** and check `ftp` disk in **Destination** tab.

## Console commands

Plugin will create three new artisan commands for working with a console.

**backup:run** command will run new backup process. Add **--only-db** option for backup only database.

**backup:clean** command will run clean old backups process.

**backup:list** command will display status of all monitored destination filesystems.

**backup:monitor** command will check status of all monitored destination filesystems.

## Mail notifications

Plugin can send notifications when:

- backup was successful,
- backup has failed,
- cleanup was successful,
- cleanup has failed,
- healthy backup was found,
- unhealthy backup was found.

To configure this feature go to plugin **Settings** and **Notifications** tab.
